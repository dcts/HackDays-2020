Repo for the Hack-Days 2020.

### Challenge: Schäbisch Hall - Bausparen in the 21st Century

**Task**: Create a closing option (path to purchase), focused on the digital conclusion of the “Bauspar contract”. Make the conclusion easy and bring joy to the process. Figure out what works best with the target group – either the experience of the customer´s journey or their monetary benefits.

**Company**: [Schwäbisch Hall](https://www.schwaebisch-hall.de/) is the largest German institution to offer contractual savings for housing. With 7.2 Mio. people it has the largest Bauspar-customer base. As a provider of financial services for the private housing industry it is firmly anchored in the cooperative banking sector. Together with Schwäbisch Hall's sales force of approximately 3.300 representatives, qualified advice and customer care is guaranteed.

### Mind Map
- mini game?
- cute illustrations that help educating/onboarding the users. For example [Headspace explenation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN6g2mr0p3Q)
- copy the concept of [VIAC](https://viac.ch/), a swiss app that lets you sign a savings agreement with just a few clicks and also allows to stat with as few as 1$ per month!
